# Overview
This repository contains the various projects that my teammates and I worked on during the Fall 2021 semester.  The main project of focus is [Project 6/7](https://github.com/xjseabrum/LING5448-OOAD/tree/main/Project6) where we implemented an MVC framework in creating a virtual casino.  The link contains more details about the project itself and even a video discussing what each of us did in constructing it.  

Projects 1-4 were projects designed by the professor so as to get us exposed to the various OOAD patterns and concepts.  In short, these patterns and concepts can help programmers create more legible, robust, and clean code.  Projects 1-4 are all in Java, whereas projects 5-7 are all in Python.
